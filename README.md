Q. Identify the purpose of your Content Management System and write a one-page document where you describe:
What is it?
How does it work?
for what kind of entities will you need to implement the index/detail/create/edit/delete actions?  


Our CMS model, named "Bingo", is a web-based game that features four navigation bars to aid users in navigating the game. The Home page allows users to click on the "Play Now" button to begin playing. The Game Rules page provides detailed instructions and winning conditions for the game. The About page introduces the creators of the game and page. Lastly, the Contact page enables users to report any issues they may encounter while playing the game by filling out and submitting a form.

In addition to the four navigation bars, our CMS model consists of three entities within the game itself. The first entity is the Pause button, which allows users to temporarily halt the game in the event of any unexpected situations that may arise while playing. The second entity is the Fill button, which is clicked before starting the game to randomly fill the user's e-bingo card. The third entity is the Done button, which makes the filled numbers not editable. Our aim to to continuously check for Bingo each time a number is said by a player.
These entities serve to enhance the user's experience by providing additional functionality and convenience during gameplay.
